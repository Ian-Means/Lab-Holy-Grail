<body>
    <header>
        The header has the default position of static, as the position propery has not been set. 
        This means it remains in document flow, and there are no offsets to affect the positioning.
    </header>
    <nav>
        The navigation bar has fixed positioning, so it will remain on screen. It is offset from 
        the top and left of the main body.
    </nav>
    <div>
        <div class="articles">
            <article>
                The articles are placed inside a div with relative positioning which remains in 
                document flow, meaning will stack under the header with no offset.
            </article>
            <article>
                The articles themselves also have relative positioning and will remain in document 
                flow within the container div. Each is offset from its default position from the 
                top by 15 pixels.
            </article>
        </div>
    <aside>
        The aside has absolute positioning, taking it out of document flow. It is offset from the 
        top by a fixed amount, while also offset from the left and right by an amount relative to 
        the container width.
    </aside>
    </div>
    <footer>
        Like the nav bar, the footer has fixed positioning and will always remain on screen. It is 
        offset from the bottom of the main body by zero pixels.
    </footer>
</body>
